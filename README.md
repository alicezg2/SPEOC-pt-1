# SPEOC-pt-1

**Please read the issue because it summarizes what needs to be
worked on**

All this code is from what I was working on in Jupyter Notebook.

You can pretty much ignore everything after the kernel which runs
the code on the Marine_Liquidated_Debt_Certificates.xlsx file. The 
rest were tests and results that I ran on other files which no 
longer work because the code has been changed.

The main thing I did since last meeting was write the standardize
function. It aims to give all the Excel sheets the same shape as 
a DataFrame so we can deal with them in the same way. It also broke
the rest of the code I had written.

**I will be away from computer access for the next couple weeks.
If you have questions, you can text me and I will try to respond.**
